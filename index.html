        <h2>hello</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Ben. I am currently a senior at UC Berkeley majoring <span class="highlight">Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</span>, while minoring in <span class="highlight">History</span>. I spend my time on campus redesigning and building websites for clients through a student-run creative agency, Innovative Design, with the simple goal of trying to make berkeley beauitful. This past summer, I was a front-end engineering intern at Salesforce on their Communities Cloud team, working on improving the UI of products.</p>
        <p>This Fall, I'm looking forward to a lighter course load and having more time to work on side projects (and become better than my housemates in Overwatch). You can reach me at bsmarimon@berkeley.edu.</p><br />
